  <h1>Fuego Core XML Diff and Patch Tool</h1>

The Fuego Core XML Diff and Patch tool is a fast and memory-efficient
general-purpose tool for diffing and patching XML files. The underlying
algorithms have been described in  
T. Lindholm, J. Kangasharju, and S. Tarkoma: 
  <i>Fast and Simple XML Tree Differencing by Sequence Alignment</i>, 
Proceedings of ACM DocEng 2006. 
<a href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1166160.1166183">[acm.org]</a> 
<a href="http://www.hiit.fi/files/fi/fc/papers/doceng06-pc.pdf">[hiit.fi]</a>.

<p>The source code for the tool is released under the permissive
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT license</a></p>

<h2>Installation from Source</h2>

<p>At this point, we only provide source-based installation from the
  <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> repository
here at Hoslab. Sorry. We're looking into providing more
straightforward methods, such as a downloadable binary. Please request
an alternate method if you find that you'll need one.

<p>To install the tool using the subversion repository at Hoslab, 
proceed as follows.

<ol>
<li>Make sure you have Subversion, a Java Development Kit (>=version
  1.6), and Apache Ant (>=1.7, older ones may work) installed. In
  Debian based-distributions, make sure the
  package <code>ant-optional</code> is installed.</li>
<li>Check out the sources using Subversion:
<pre>
svn co svn://hoslab.cs.helsinki.fi/svnfc-xmldiff
</pre></li>
<li>Then, <pre>cd trunk/java/xmldiff</pre></li>
<li>Run<pre>ant</pre>to get instructions on how to proceed project setup.
The project setup phase should download all dependencies automatically.</li>
<li>After project setup is completed, invoke (again)
<pre>ant</pre>
to compile the sources.
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Diffing XML</h2>

The easiest way to get the diff between the files <code>old.xml</code>
and <code>new.xml</code> into <code>diff.xml</code> is to invoke
the <code>diff</code> Ant task:
<pre>
ant -Dbase=old.xml -Dnew=new.xml -Ddiff=diff.xml diff
</pre>
Naturally, you may invoke the tool using <code>java</code> directly with
the appropriate classpath. For instance,
<pre>
java -Djava.ext.dirs=../contrib/jar:contrib -cp =build/lib/xmldiff.jar fc.xml.diff.Diff old.xml new.xml diff.xml
</pre>

<h2>Patching XML</h2>

As for diffing, their is an Ant target for patching. To patch 
<code>old.xml</code> with <code>diff.xml</code> to get 
<code>new.xml</code>, you run
<pre>
ant -Dbase=old.xml -Ddiff=diff.xml -Dnew=new.xml patch
</pre>
As in the previous case, direct invocation can also be used. In this case
the main class is <code>fc.xml.diff.Patch</code>
